## About me...

Hi there! I'm Philip.

As an IT professional and enthusiast working in academia, my days are filled with a variety of challenges and opportunities. From desktop support covering both hardware and software, to training and creating documentation, I love solving problems and enhancing productivity with technology. 

I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have a career that not only aligns with but also fuels my passion for technology.

In the ever-evolving world of technology, staying ahead means embracing lifelong learning. Understanding the basics, mastering the fundamentals, and constantly exploring new avenues are principles I live by to prepare for what's next.

This blog is my platform for "learning out loud." It's where I share those "today I learned" moments, from the simple basics to more complex topics. My goal is to create the resource I wish I had when I was starting out—a space that not only helps me understand what I'm working with but also fosters a community for growth, discussion, and discovery.

I hope you find value in what I share and join in the conversation, sparking insights and ideas that help us all evolve.

Looking forward to learning and growing together!

Philip
